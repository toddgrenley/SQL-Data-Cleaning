# SQL-Data-Cleaning

This is a project I chose to practice and demonstrate Data Cleaning skills using SQL. The original file with the housing data has some format issues and in general is just not
particularly usable for data exploration and analysis. So we remedy this by reformatting and doing things like breaking large, cumbersome columns into smaller, more workable 
units that are more conducive to analysis.
